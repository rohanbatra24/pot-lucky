# Potlucky

Potlucky helps you optimize your food consumption, reduce food waste, and make fewer trips to the grocery store by suggesting recipes based on the items in your kitchen pantry.

## How to use Potlucky

Simply input the items in your pantry, specify which items you would like to consume, and Potlucky will give you a list of popular recipes based on the items that you selected.

You can also perform a raw search of recipes that utilize ingredients, such as `cheese` or `bananas`. If you perform a raw search instead of asking Potlucky to generate recipes based on your pantry, you will be informed whether or not you have the required ingredients in your pantry to make each recipe.

If you wish, you can also filter by vegan, gluten-free, cuisine, preparation time, allergies, and more.
